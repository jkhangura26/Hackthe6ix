*Discover how eco-friendly you really are!*

## **Inspiration**
Inspired by compelling visualizations that highlight individual carbon emissions, we envisioned a tool that empowers users to understand their environmental impact. The idea of a carbon footprint calculator emerged as a crucial step toward helping individuals recognize where their emissions originate. We believe that impactful visuals can drive this understanding home.

## **What It Does**
Ever wondered, *What is my carbon footprint?* or *How can I visualize my impact?* **SeeO2** answers these questions by providing a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis. 

Harnessing the power of **MATLAB** and **Blender**, we not only calculate your carbon score but also visualize your emissions, offering deeper insights into your environmental impact and highlighting the benefits of reducing your footprint.

## **How We Built It**
We leveraged **MATLAB** and its **App Designer** to create an intuitive carbon scoring application, which efficiently computes the necessary data for visualizations. Next, we transitioned to **Blender** to bring those visuals to life, crafting stunning representations of your carbon emissions.

## **Challenges We Faced**
Initially, we planned to create the visualizations within MATLAB, capitalizing on its robust functionality. However, we encountered performance issues and implementation challenges. Our exploration of **Simulink** for modeling visuals also proved to be more complex than anticipated within our time constraints. Ultimately, we pivoted to **Blender**, which required us to learn a new platform from scratch and develop a method to integrate MATLAB and Blender effectively.

## **Accomplishments We’re Proud Of**
- Successfully utilizing **MATLAB** for user interface and logic development.
- Crafting stunning visualizations in **Blender** that bring emissions data to life.

## **What We Learned**
We deepened our understanding of app development with **MATLAB** and its powerful visualization capabilities. Additionally, we gained valuable insights into extending functionality between MATLAB and Blender, harnessing the full potential of both platforms.

## **What’s Next for SeeO2**
- **Localization Options**: Enable users to set their country for a more accurate carbon score.
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Develop tailored options for businesses to track progress toward ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide concrete steps individuals can take to meaningfully reduce their carbon footprint.
- **AI Integration**: Implement AI to analyze electricity bills and extract relevant information for improved user profiles.
- **Augmented Reality**: Explore AR capabilities to elevate visualizations and engage users in new ways.
